# DATA \

------------------------- "/LED coherence/" ----------------------------\
In this folder you find the data related with the depolarization of the LED source used throught a variable LC retarder. Each file named from 0.csv - 4000nm.csv contains 100 measurents of the emergent light polarization state, their stokes parameters and degree of polarization. The main interest with this data is to extract the degree of polarization in order to measure the LED coherence function.

------------------------- "/caracterization circular/" ----------------------------\
In this folder you find the data related with the measurement of incident light beam polarization state that is supposed to be circularlly polarized in the biplate depolarization experiment.

------------------------- "/caracterization elliptical/" ----------------------------\
In this folder you find the data related with the measurement of incident light beam polarization state that is supposed to be elliptically polarized in the biplate depolarization experiment.

------------------------- "/caracterization linear/" ----------------------------\
In this folder you find the data related with the measurement of incident light beam polarization state that is supposed to be linearlly polarized in the biplate depolarization experiment.

------------------------- "/circular/" ----------------------------\
In this folder you find the data related with the depolarization of an of incident LED light beam circularlly polarized throught a biplate system as a function of the biplate rotation angle. Each file named from 0.csv - 45.csv contains 200 measurents of the emergent light polarization state, their stokes parameters and degree of polarization.

------------------------- "/elliptical/" ----------------------------\
In this folder you find the data related with the depolarization of an of incident LED light beam elliptically polarized throught a biplate system as a function of the biplate rotation angle. Each file named from 0.csv - 45.csv contains 200 measurents of the emergent light polarization state, their stokes parameters and degree of polarization.

------------------------- "/linear/" ----------------------------\
In this folder you find the data related with the depolarization of an of incident LED light beam lineally polarized throught a biplate system as a function of the biplate rotation angle. Each file named from 0.csv - 45.csv contains 200 measurents of the emergent light polarization state, their stokes parameters and degree of polarization.
